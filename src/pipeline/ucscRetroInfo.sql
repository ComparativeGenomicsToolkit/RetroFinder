# ucscRetroInfo.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated ucscRetroInfo.c and ucscRetroInfo.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Retrogenes based on cDNA alignments that are expressed or processed pseudogenes.
