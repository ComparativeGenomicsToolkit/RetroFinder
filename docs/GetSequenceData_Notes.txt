Written script so far to read in variable names, create output files and 
has functions to get the database prefix e.g. hg from hg38. 
__getSeqsFromGenbank() runs gbGetSeqs. Needs output file as input.
In ucscRetroStep1.sh - the sequences are piped through an awk to change 
bases to upper case. Is this necessary? It also substitutes Ns for some 
non-ATCG bases. These could be IUPAC codes and if they are not then want
it to fail at a later step and give error. lastz is now run with option 
--iupac=ambiguous so these codes will be acceptable.

- add import subprocess
- get function working that calls gbGetSeqs, how to you add inputs such as -db=gbdb where gbdb is a variable. Perhaps need to make a string. 
gbdb = "-db=" + self.__getDatabasePrefix()
gbR = "-gbRoot=" + gbRoot

Test:
/cluster/data/genbank/bin/x86_64/gbGetSeqs -inclVersion -native -db=mm \
-gbRoot=/cluster/data/genbank refSeq mrna \
/hive/users/hartera/GencodeWG/retroFinder/trunk/src/pipeline/bin/mm10/20150122/sequenceData/refGene.fa

# this works and returns 33610 RefSeq sequences for mouse.
