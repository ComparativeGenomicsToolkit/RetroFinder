2) chr12:44923180-44924366 mouse mm10, retro-Nanog
AB126939.1-3, Retroposed Genes V5
This is a retrogene (processed pseudogene) with an alignment gap due to a
LINE repeat. Yale's PseudoPipe predicts it to be a duplicated pseudogene -
PGOMOU00000269970 (Release based on Ensembl 78). RetroFinder does not mistake
such gaps as being introns if they are due to repeat insertions. However,
PseudoPipe does not do that and probably mistakes this gap for an intron.
