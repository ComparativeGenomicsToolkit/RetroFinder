Inputs and Outputs:

lastz is run in ucscRetroStep1.sh on input sequences to align them to the
genome. In ucscRetroStep2.sh, then do chaining and result is mrnaBlastz.psl
and sorted to be mrnaBlastz.sort.psl, this is filtered and processed to  
pslPseudo is the main program that generates the final list of retrogenes and 
associated information. 

pslPseudo is run by the doBuildpk.sh script which is called in ucscRetroStep3.sh 
OUTDIR=/hive/groups/gencode/pseudogenes/retroFinder/$DB.$DATE/retro/version${VERSION}/${DB}
Inputs to pslPseudo:
-cdsFile=cds.tab.gz - made in ucscRetroStep1.sh, acc, version, name, type from 
refSeqs and mRNAs (or from whatever sequences used as input). name field is the 
CDS in the cds table (one of the genbank tables)
database name - defined as DB in the DEF parameters file 
split/tmp<id>.psl - lastz alignments of input mRNAs and RefSeqs (or other
input sequences) 
assembly chrom sizes - from browser, usually in /hive/data/genomes/<db>
repeatMasker, rmsk.bed.gz - ucscRetroStep3.sh, mySQL query to rmsk table in
DB 
net1.txt.gz - ucscRetroStep3.sh, query to NET1 (defined in DEF file) table in <db>
net2.txt.gz - ucscRetroStep3.sh, query to NET2 (defined in DEF file) table in
DB
simpleRepeat.bed.gz - ucscRetroStep3, query to simpleRepeat table in DB
all_mrna.psl.gz - ucscRetroStep1.sh, query to all_mrna and refSeqAli to get
PSL alignments and combine them. These are the alignments to the genome of all
sequences used as input to RetroFinder.
<db>.2bit - genome assembly sequence file in twoBit format
mrna.2bit - twoBit format sequence file of mRNAs and RefSeqs or other sequence
input that was aligned by lastz 
refGene.tab.gz 
gencode.tab.gz (or ensGene.tab.gz)
knownGene.tab.gz
net3.txt.gz

Output: 
mrna<id>.psl - best alignments with and without introns, OUTPUT 
pseudo<id>.psl - retrogene/pseudogene PSL alignments, OUTPUT
pseudoMrnaLink<id>.txt - stores link between pseudogene and gene (Parent?),
is this the ucscRetroInfo table?
pseudo<id>.axt - axt output of retrogenes/pseudogenes
ortho<id>.txt - break in orthology information for ucscRetroOrtho table

PSLPSEUDO - what happens to pseudoMrnaLink*.txt files. 
In doBuildpk.sh, if field32 is 1 or 2 then copy line to pseudoGeneLink<id>.bed
gzip the pseudoMrnaLink<id>.txt file and copy to RESULT -result dir in OUTDIR
Also copy pseudoGeneLink<id>.bed file to $OUTDIR/result.
# there are a lot of post processing steps after creating this file and before
# loading it nto the database. 
# need to figure out what files are not needed but were probably produced for
# analysis. 
ucscRetroStep4.sh - filtering step, cat pseudoGeneLink[0-9]*.bed and then 
select those lines with score > 300, and axtScore > 10,000 or is equal to -1. 
removeTandemDups removes retros that have parents on the same chromosome are 
in 200 kb of the retro to remove false positives due to tandemly duplicated 
gene families. output: pseudoGeneLinkSortFilter.bed
Uses bedOverlap to remove Overlaps from bed files - choose highest scoring
bed. output: pseudoGeneLinkNoOverlap.bed  
ucscRetroStep5.sh - filters out immunoglobulins and zinc fingers and 
resulting file is ucscRetroInfo${VERSION}.bed and this is loaded into the 
database as ucscRetroInfo${VERSION}.
Also filters ortho.txt file (produced from pslPseudo) so contains the same
retrogenes as ucscRetroInfo and this ortho.filter.txt is loaded as the 
ucscRetroOrtho${VERSION}.
