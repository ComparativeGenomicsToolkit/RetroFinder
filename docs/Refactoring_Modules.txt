1) GetSequenceData - gets sequences for input to RetroFinder. mRNAs and RefSeqs and alignments in PSL format. Has options to input ensembl sequences or to use 
other sequence data. Sequences and/or alignments can also be supplied in a
file. Based on script: ucscRetroStep1.sh
NOTE: Add filtering function so can remove blacklisted sequences.
2) ProcessSequences - remove polyA tails. create files of sequence lengths with
and without polyA tails (lift file). Based on script: ucscRetroStep1.sh
NOTE: Should this be part of GetSequenceData?
3) ChainLastz - remove duplicate PSLs.  chain lastz alignments, filter chains, 
convert to PSL. polyA tails reattached and concatenate all the PSLs. 
pslFilter filters alignments and then qNames are made unique by adding
suffixes e.g. -1,-2,-3
4) GetPslPseudoData - get input data for pslPseudo. simple repeats,
RepeatMasker, nets (3 sets, NET1, NET2, NET3, two near, one far). Gene 
annotations (3 sets, GENE1, GENE2, GENE3). Only require one set of genes.
Based on script: ucscRetroStep3.sh
5) RunPslPseudo - prepare for pslPseudo cluster runs and run on the cluster. 
Based on script: ucscRetroStep3.sh and doBuildpk.sh
6) ProcessPslPseudoOutput - filter the output from pslPseudo. Removed 
overlapping annotations. Filters out retrogenes that are zinc finger,
immunoglobulin, NBFP and olfactory receptor genes if there is a PFAM table. 
Create a cds file of id with version and CDS range for ucscRetroCds table.
filter orthologs file so it contains only ids in final ucscRetroInfo file.
Create file of retrogenes and counts by gene symbol where score > 650 and
count > 1 and the average score is calculated for each gene. 
Based on script: ucscRetroStep4.sh and ucscRetroStep5.sh
7) FilterSeqsForExpress - filter mRNAs and ESTs to use for expression
analysis. Input is PSL BLAT alignments of mRNAs and ESTs from Genbank - remove
alignments with multiple hits that are ambiguous by picking the best hits. 
Removes problem EST sequeences from gbWarn. 
NOTE: are there mRNAs in gbWarn? Also consider removing all blacklisted
sequences.
8) AnalyseExpression - Produces the pseudoExpressed.gp file for the
ucscRetroExpressed table. Expression analysis based on mRNA and EST overlap.
Based on script: analyseExpress.sh
9) LoadDatabase - original sequence input files, mrna.fa and refseq.fa are
symlinked to /gbdb/<db>/lastzRetro<version>
NOTE: where should sequence files reside. At moment they are in:
/hive/data/genomes/<db>/bed/mrnaBlastz.<version> directory.
Load tables: ucscRetroInfo, ucscRetroCds, ucscRetroOrtho, ucscRetroAli,
ucscRetroExpressed, ucscRetroCount

# NOTE: The SCORETHRESH has never been applied in these scripts!
# It is hard-coded into ucscRetroStep5.sh as 510 which is the threshold
# for mouse, human is 550 so close enough.
# So this should be applied. Maybe input threshold into a driver script.

sequences are loaded into ucscRetroSeq and ucscRetroExtFile tables.
Based on script: ucscRetroStep2.sh 

2015-01-28:
NOTE: in future, should filter input mRNAs to remove those that are
blacklisted, same for ESTs that are used for expression analysis. 
NOTE: Should filter CDS table so only includes those mRNA ids that are in the
ucscRetroAli and Info tables.
