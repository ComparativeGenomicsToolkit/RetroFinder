1) GetSequenceData - gets sequences for input to RetroFinder. mRNAs and RefSeqs and alignments in PSL format. Has options to input ensembl sequences or to use 
other sequence data. Sequences and/or alignments can also be supplied in a
file. Based on script: ucscRetroStep1.sh
2) ProcessSequences - remove polyA tails. create files of sequence lengths with
and without polyA tails. Based on script: ucscRetroStep1.sh
NOTE: Should this be part of GetSequenceData
3) ChainLastz - remove duplicate PSLs.  chain lastz alignments, filter chains, 
convert to PSL. polyA tails reattached and concatenate all the PSLs. 
pslFilter filters alignments and then qNames are made unique by adding
suffixes e.g. -1,-2,-3


x) LoadDatabase - original sequence input files, mrna.fa and refseq.fa are
symlinked to /gbdb/<db>/lastzRetro<version>
NOTE: where should sequence files reside. At moment they are in:
/hive/data/genomes/<db>/bed/mrnaBlastz.<version> directory.
sequences are loaded into ucscRetroSeq and ucscRetroExtFile tables.
